# Sleepy-driver
Arduino project to curb Drowsy drivers
FIRST ECG is the processing code to plot the heart rate of a patient on a processing graph to view the heart rate . 
This can be developed further to find the PQRST interval using inovative algorithms and a bit odf smart coding . 

Fistcode_donotdelete is the code which conetcts to the GSM module and sends messages over the phone when a driver is either sleepy or drunk as in this state , he is not in the state f mind to drive a car as in all probablitiy , he will crash the car and cause a lot of havoc .
This system connected to the arduono will stop this bad practise.
